## Introduction

The original project [wangEditor](https://github.com/wangeditor-team/wangEditor) is temporarily not maintained due to the author's [personal reasons](https://juejin.cn/post/7272735633458413602). This project is a forked version that will continue to be maintained without breaking changes as much as possible.

An open-source web rich text editor that is ready to use out of the box with simple configuration. It supports JS, Vue, and React.
